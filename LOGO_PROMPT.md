# Ymirge Logo - ChatGPT/DALL-E Prompt

## Concept
Ymirge is a procedural terrain generator. The name evokes Norse mythology (Ymir, the primordial giant whose body became the world) merged with "forge" - a tool for creating worlds.

## Prompt

```
Create a minimalist logo for "Ymirge", a procedural terrain generation tool.

Design elements:
- A stylized mountain peak or terrain silhouette forming the letter "Y"
- The mountain could have subtle contour lines suggesting a topographic map
- Clean, geometric style with sharp angles
- Optional: small grid/mesh pattern at the base suggesting 3D terrain mesh

Color scheme:
- Primary: Deep blue (#1a365d) or charcoal (#2d3748)
- Accent: Warm orange/amber (#ed8936) for peak highlights or accent elements
- Alternative: Gradient from earth brown to snow white on the peak

Style:
- Modern, flat design with minimal gradients
- Should work at small sizes (favicon) and large sizes
- Professional enough for a developer tool
- Transparent background

Format: Square aspect ratio, centered design
```

## Alternative Concepts

**Option A - Topographic Y:**
```
Minimalist "Y" shape made of topographic contour lines, like elevation rings on a map. Lines get denser toward the center suggesting a peak. Blue-green color palette. Transparent background, square format.
```

**Option B - Mesh Mountain:**
```
Low-poly/wireframe mountain peak that subtly forms the letter Y in its silhouette. White wireframe on dark blue background, or dark wireframe on transparent. Single accent color for peak vertices. Modern geometric style.
```

**Option C - Nordic Rune Style:**
```
The letter Y stylized as a Norse rune (Algiz ᛉ) with terrain/mountain elements integrated. Clean lines, could have subtle snow cap or terrain texture. Monochrome with one accent color. Transparent background.
```
